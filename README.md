## How it works
Psyloom helps you build rich, psychologically grounded personas from free-form descriptions — in just three steps.

1. **Describe the Personality**  
   Write a free-form description — it could be someone you know, a fictional character, or a user profile.

2. **Psyloom Builds the Mind**  
   We analyze your input and generate a detailed psychological model, including traits, values, emotions, and behavioral patterns.

3. **Start Interacting**  
   Use the personality via our API — simulate reactions, generate text, or explore decisions based on how that persona would think and feel.
